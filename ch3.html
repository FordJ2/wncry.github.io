                                    The Ryzen 5 2600 has the perfect balance between budget and performance. With 6 cores and 12 threads at 3.6 Ghz base, and 3.9 Ghz boost, it can do everything a business owner, such as yourself, could dream of, at a reasonable price. A CPU cooler is included with the CPU.

                                    Crucial Ballistix has some of the cleanest RAM (Random Access Memory) in the industry. Their sleek design catches many an eye, while staying at an increadible price. To fit within the $800 budget, initially only buy one set of two. However, once your business expands and you start makeing some profits, I would highly recommend purchasing a second set of RAM DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) for a total of 16 GB.

                                    As a part of the new 5000 series of Ryzen CPUs, the Ryzen 5 5600X puts an emphasis on perfomance above all else.

                                    Nowadays one can't do much without at least 16 GB of RAM. 32 GB is the perfect mix between affordable and future proof. 32 GB at 3200 Mhz should also eliminate the possibility for RAM to be a possible bottleneck in your system.

                                    For an avid gamer such as yourself, storage needs to fit 2 requirements: fast and large. Here, I have listed a boot drive; this is what you will be installing windows on. Its highspeed NVME capabilities with a 512MB cache makes it perfect for fast loading times in games, as well as other software. I would not recommend installing large games on this, but rather small high perfroming applications.

                                    To start off with, 2 TB should be enough for anybody. The highly reliable high capacity can lead you to victory in many a game. Down the road as your game collection expands fatrther into the terrabytes, I would recommend buying two or even three of some of Seagates linup.

                                    The 3060 Ti is arguably the best graphics card on the market from a price to performance standpoint. Its 8 GB of VRAM is more than enough for texture packs, and its RTX capabilities leave its competators in the dust. <a href="https://bit.ly/3bw9sGp">Here</a> is an article that I wrote last year for school. Please note that you might need to borrow some money from a friend in order to purchase this card. If you are unable to obtain the funds immediatly, I would recommend saving up for just a little while longer.

                                    The Cougar MG120 is an outstanding case. Its looks match its reputation, all the while remaining relatively cheap. This case is notably easy to work in, and can provide you with an excellent first experience building a computer.

                                    The EVGA G3 550W 80+ Gold is one of those power supplies that everyone recommends. One of things that set this apart from many of the other PSUs, is its 80+ Gold rating at $50. 80+ is a voluntary standard of certification that is accepted by all. Gold, is its thrid highest rating of power supplies (out of 6). This power supply can get what you need done, while staying within your budget. If you are planning on dealing with highly sensitive information, I would recommend you purchase an external UPS (uninterupted power supply) as it can prevent falure in a blackout.

                                    While not being too flashy, you will definitly appreciate having a 1920x1080 screen no matter the workload. And coming in at only $100, I would say that its a pretty good deal.
